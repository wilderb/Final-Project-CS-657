Final project created by Wilder Blake, email: blakew@uwm.edu

A series of small rooms with puzzles/obstacles to navigate through. Connect the pipes and fill them up, or insert a battery orb into the receptacle to activate the door to the next room.
Batteries are destroyed if they come in contact with lasers.

Activate signs by pointing at them with your left hand (clutching the hand trigger and removing your finger from the figner trigger) then press Y.
Activate 'telekinetic powers' to reach objects across barriers by holding your left hand to your head and pressing the left finger trigger.

3D assets made by me.
